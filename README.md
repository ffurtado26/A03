<h1>Installing Git</h1>
  <p>So in order to get Git, we will need to head over to <a href="https://git-scm.com">This link</a>.
    Click on the OS you currently use on the downloads page. <br>
    Next, you would confirm or change your install path.The next page would be your components page. <br>
    I would add it on desktop for people new to Git. You will select a start menu folder, I would personally leave it at the default option for now. <br>
    The next page will be choosing the default editor when using git, I stuck with Vim, please note that while Vim is powerful, it can be hard to use! <br>
    You can change it later on using a command if need be. <br>
    Next page will be adjusting your path environment, I selected the second option "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software." <br>
    Configuring the line ending conversions will be the next page, I personally selected the first option which would use Unix-style line endings, in case you're ever on linux you don't have to mess with it. <br>
    The terminal emulator should be set to MinTTY, its more configurable and lightweight. <br>
    From here on, I would select default options for the next couple of pages. After the setup, you are done. <br>
    I do recommend you selecting a higher font size, by right-clicking anywhere on the white frame, going to text, click your preferable size, and you are done!</p>

<br>
<br>

<h1>Installing Webstorm</h1>

<p>
  While Webstorm is not free, being a student can guarantee free access to this IDE. Head over to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=windows"> This link</a> and sign up<br>
  I would also recommend going on <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">This link</a> to download a free student pack with essential tools from Github. <br>
  After you've downloaded Webstorm you will be prompted with the "WebStorm" setup. <br>
  After choosing your path, you should select all associations, such as js, .css, .html, and json. <br>
  You will then be prompted to the directory page, click "do not import settings' since this will be your first time using it. <br>
  After you're done downloading WebStorm, login for you to get access the software, follow the simple directions related to your account. <br>
  You now can create a new project in whichever language you'd like. Happy Coding!

<h1>Using GitHub</h1>

<p>
  Github is a source control platform, that most developers use! <br>
  Just as stated above sign up for the student pack on GitHub to access a plethora of different tools you will need. <br>
  So to start a repository lets click in the upper right corner next to your profile, and click the + and then New repository. <br>
  Name it whatever you'd like, along with a short description and select "Initialize this repository with a README" <br>
  Every repo has a main branch, to create a new branch click on your new repo, go to branch:main type a branch name, then select create a new branch. <br>
  Commits or saved changes, capture the history of changes done on the project.<br>
  To make commit changes, click the readme.md file, click on the pencil icon, edit any feature, then write a commit message explaining your changes. <br>
  Click on the commit changes when done. <br>
  Pull requests is requesting a "GitMaster" to review and pull your contribution to their branch. <br>
  Click on the pull request tab, click on the green create pull request button, give it a title and address the changes done thus far. <br>
  When reviewed and approved, It's time to merge your pull request. <br>
  Click on confirm merge which will be a green button, then delete the branch since the changes have been incorporated. <br>
  You are now one step closer to becoming proficient in GitHub
